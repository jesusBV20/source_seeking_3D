# Resiliend Source Seeking with robot swarms - 3D

In this repository, we implement a 3D PD control in SO(3) to align robot swarms with the ascending direction given by our resilient source-seeking algorithm. For a comprehensive understanding of the mathematical theory underlying this code, we recommend reviewing the following works:

## Features
This project includes:

* A 3D resilient source-seeking algorithm implementation.
* A Proportional-Derivative (PD) feedback controller for 3D heading control, implemented in SO(3) for systems with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).
* Numerical tools for computing mathematical expressions necessary to operate in SO(3), (e.g., different techniques to compute the exponential and logarithmic maps).

## Quick Install

To install, run:

```bash
python install.py
```

## Usage

We recommend running the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to get an overview of the project's structure and see the code in action.
