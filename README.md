# Resiliend Source Seeking in 3D

In this repository, we implement a 3D PD control in SO(3) to align with the ascending direction given by our resilient source-seeking algorithm for robot swarms. To understand the mathematical theory behind this code, we highly recommend to consult our following works:

Throughout this project, you will find the following features:

* An implementation of our resilient source-seeking algorithm in 3D.
* A Proportional + Derivative feedback controller for the 3D heading. It is implemented in SO(3) and works for systems with 3 DOF (degrees of freedom). 
* Some numerical tools to compute the mathematical expression that we need to work in SO(3) (e.g., different techniques to compute the exp and log map).
