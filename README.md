# Resiliend Source Seeking with robot swarms - 3D

In this repository, we implement a 3D PD control in SO(3) to align robot swarms with the ascending direction given by our resilient source-seeking algorithm. For a comprehensive understanding of the mathematical theory underlying this code, we recommend reviewing the following works:

## Features
This project includes:

* A 3D resilient source-seeking algorithm implementation.
* A Proportional-Derivative (PD) feedback controller for 3D heading control, implemented in SO(3) for systems with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).
* Numerical tools for computing mathematical expressions necessary to operate in SO(3), (e.g., different techniques to compute the exponential and logarithmic maps).

## Installation

We recommend creating a dedicated virtual environment to ensure that the project dependencies do not conflict with other Python packages:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Then, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ```requirements.txt``` contains the versions tested for **compatibility with the simulator**.
Do **not modify the versions** to ensure stable and reproducible environments. Note that ```ssl_simulator``` already provides stable versions for the following core packages: ```numpy```, ```matplotlib```, ```tqdm```, ```pandas```, ```scipy```, ```ipython```.

### Additional Dependencies
Some additional dependencies, such as LaTeX fonts and FFmpeg, may be required. We recommend following the installation instructions provided in the ```ssl_simulator``` [README](https://github.com/Swarm-Systems-Lab/ssl_simulator/blob/master/README.md). 

## Usage

We recommend running the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to get an overview of the project's structure and see the code in action.
